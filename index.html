                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p> Lumoflare is a small, ethereal creature that appears to be composed of soft, fluid lines and geometric shapes. Its body resembles that of a floating sphere or a gently pulsating jellyfish, with tentacle-like appendages that radiate outward in smooth, fluid arcs.The Lumoflare's colors and shapes change according to the alternation of day and night. During the day, he is indistinguishable from an ordinary jellyfish, and at night he floats to the surface of the water and becomes rigid, like a tree. </p>

                <h3 class="red">Habitat:</h3>
                <p> Lumoflare inhabit dense bioluminescent forests on distant mist-shrouded planets. These forests are filled with glowing fungi and towering trees that emit a faint blue-green glow.Lumoflare are often found near flowing streams or waterfalls that refract the light through the dense foliage of the trees, thus sometimes making them green. Nebula forests are known for their high concentration of oxygen and organic light sources, making them an ideal environment for Lumoflare to thrive.</p>

            <p> <span class="yellow">what we know so far about this creature:</span> The researchers stumbled upon Lumoflare while studying the effects of ambient light on the plants of the Nebular Jungle Little is known about their social structure, but they seem to change shape during the day and night. It is unclear whether Lumoflare have a fixed morphology, as they appear to be indistinguishable from normal jellyfish during the day. But at night they become very aggressive. The researchers suspect that the effect of light causes this change. It could be that because they feed on sunlight during the day and don't get enough light at night, they become rigid and grow like trees. Floating to the surface of the water, they feed on the bubbles on the surface. And the mysterious force that helps them to get to the bubbles is still not understood. Some speculate it's the flute of a distant shepherd, while others guess it's actually controlled by humans.
